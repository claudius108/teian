						The head of the European Department of the Japanese Foreign
						Ministry declared confidentially that the Japanese
						Ambassador to Berlin had
						received the
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06163.jpg" n="6,163" xml:id="pb.16" />
						direction today to express congratulations to the Japanese government to the
						Reich government to the German success
						and to point out at this opportunity
						Japan's special interest in the future fate of French Indo-China. The
						Ambassador is to reiterate Japan's thanks for the friendly German attitude
						in the China conflict, and at the same
						time stress the fact that Japan
						believes she has rendered Germany essential services in the European war by
						tying
						down American forces in the Pacific Ocean. The Ambassador is
						instructed to suggest that the German government make
						some friendly gesture
						on the subject of Indo-China in appreciation of Japan's attitude. Asked what
						such a gesture
						might be the confidant said the Foreign Ministry is thinking
						of a German declaration according to which Japan would
						receive a free hand
						in Indo-China. According to newspapers, the Japanese Ambassador had received
						identical
						instructions.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.26">
						Since, as a result of the collapse of France, the pressure
						of the activistic public opinion on the cabinet became
						increasingly
						stronger, the Foreign Minister evidently decided on this step, in order to
						save his policy and to keep
						the cabinet from the otherwise inevitable
						collapse. There is no doubt about the existence of the danger that the
						Foreign
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06164.jpg" n="6,164" xml:id="pb.17" />
						Minister would make tactical use of possible German blanc authorization
						concerning Indo-China in his attempt to
						bring about a compromise with
						America. Characteristic for the basically unchanged attitude of the Foreign
						Minister
						is the elsewhere reported fact, that he concluded friendly
						agreement on (one group of letters garbled) . . . at the
						same day with
						France and England in Tientsin. As viewed from Tokyo, a strengthening of the
						Japanese position of
						power in East Asia through annexation of Indo-China
						would, in itself, be doubtlessly in German interest. In this
						way the chances
						for an early end of the China conflict would be increased on the one hand,
						and on the other hand,
						the differences between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon
						powers would be intensified to such an extent that the danger of
						an
						agreement would be eliminated for a long time. If, therefore, a
						consideration of the Japanese request should be
						intended, a formula would
						have to be found which would fix Japan's course definitely along the German
						lines. This
						could, first of all, be achieved if Japan would have to obligate
						herself to the immediate occupation of Indo-China.
						In this connection, I was
						confidentially told by army circles that there the idea of occupying the
						strategically
						important Yun-ann railway
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06165.jpg" n="6,165" xml:id="pb.18" />
						is being propagated. If the government should
						evade a correspondingly formulated offer for leaving Indochina to
						them, one
						would have to calculate at least with a severe blow to their position in
						case this were published and
						probably with replacement by a cabinet which
						would be close to us.

						Japan's thanks for the friendly German attitude in the China
						conflict have come pretty late; the sacrifices which
						we in fact made for
						Japan (stoppage of sending war supplies to China and consequently sacrifice
						of supply of
						important Chinese raw material) have as yet received no
						recognition from the Japanese, let alone economic
						compensation. Japan's
						desire for a friendly gesture from Germany is somewhat strange in view of
						the attitude Japan
						has taken re economic relations
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06167.jpg" n="6,167" xml:id="pb.20" />
						with Germany
						during the war.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.28">If this is to be used in countering the Japanese Ambassador
						in the forthcoming conversations, the
						following examples can be
						introduced:
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.29">(1) From the first, Japanese shipping has completely
						subscribed to the French and English blockade.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.30">(2) For a long time the Japanese Government had not met
						German wishes for transit of goods through Japan
						and had only in the dark
						shown in recent months some obligingness. Thus an assignment of wolfram from
						Canton and an
						assignment of tin from Columbia was sent on to Germany.
						Recently, the Japanese Government even offered us 100 tons
						each of wolfram
						and tin from its own stocks to be delivered without cost. However, there are
						still unfilled requests
						-- e.g. increasing the Japanese shipping service to
						Vladivostock which is only made the port of call three tines a
						month by one
						Japanese steamer. Also, further shipment of tin from Columbia has not been
						possible up till now because
						of the refusal of the Japanese shipping
						company.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.31">
						(3) In January of this year, Japan concluded a monopoly
						agreement with Manchuria for the supply of soya-beans
						without telling us
						anything
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06168.jpg" n="6,168" xml:id="pb.21" />
						although we had been the biggest customers up till then, e.g. 800,000 tons
						in 1938. After our remonstration, Japan
						has up till now only released 70,000
						tons to be supplied to us from Manchuria.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.32">(4) Japan still refuses to transport home in small groups
						from America the crew of the Colombus, nearly
						500 men, because she regards
						them as combatants, following the English interpretation, although in the
						American
						interpretation they are styled as shipwrecked survivors.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.33">(5) It is true that Japan sullied us all the whale oil from
						the last haul of 75,000 tons. However, we
						know from confidential sources
						that it first offered half of this to England, and only decided to supply it
						to us,
						when it had received no satisfactory English offer.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.38">On 19 June the Japanese Ambassadors drew me into a
						conversation regarding the future of German-Japanese
						relations. He began by
						referring to the expected visit of the former Foreign Minister Naotake SATO
						and seemed to
						want to make suggestions for the subject of the conversation
						with Mr. SATO. The Ambassador did not touch actual
						questions of German and
						Japanese policy.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.39">
						The Ambassador stated somewhat as follows: 'The knowledge
						that Japan's welfare depends not on the Western Powers,
						but that an approach
						to Germany is of significance to Japan, broke through even in circles which
						till then had been
						strangers to Germany. One
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06171.jpg" n="6,171" xml:id="pb.24" />
						indication for
						this is SATO's wish to come to Germany now. I am glad that he thus takes the
						opportunity to get to
						know the new Germany from close by and I am sure that
						his visit will be further material in the process of winning
						over the
						circles which up to now had no interest in Germany to the idea of an
						approach to Germany. Today the
						building up of heavy industry is regarded as
						the most important task in Japan. The light industry is ready for the
						greater part; where this is not the case its further development is of no
						considerable political importance and can
						be put aside. If, in the field of
						development of heavy industry, a close cooperation between Japan and Germany
						is
						possible, which I do not doubt, Japan will gain freedom of action towards
						the United States. The question of raw
						material supplies from England and
						America I do not regard as so dangerous. The raw material countries are
						under
						export pressure, especially if England should now blockade Europe.
						<corr>Therefore</corr>
						we need not fear the boycott warnings. But if our
						economic circles see Germany's great industrial development and
						realize that
						Germany is not only not behind the United States, but has overtaken her in
						many fields, they will, in
						view of the unfriendly attitude of the United
						States, gladly switch over to Germany. The improvement of
						Japanese-Russian
						relations is, as long as the present war lasts,
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06172.jpg" n="6,172" xml:id="pb.25" />
						a
						pre-requisite for this switching. TOGO and I are feverishly working for it,
						and it becomes more and more clear in
						Japan that the future of Japan lies in
						the South, and that the enemy in the North must be made a friend. Certain
						military circles are opposed to such a turn, but there too OSHIMA will have
						acted for their enlightenment in the
						meantime.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.40">After the war the German-Italian, Russian, Japanese-Chinese
						and American blocks will remain. It is
						important for Japan as well as for
						Germany that close relations between Japan and Germany will then remain or
						be
						established. I see the way to that in the first place in the economic
						field mentioned before. Germany should
						consign to the Japanese block an
						ample position in her post war economic program.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.41">
						Ambassadore SATO could be told, in case the conversation
						with him is held on this or similar lines, that the
						contribution, which is
						expected of Japan, is to show a more obliging attitude concerning Germany's
						wants for raw
						materials in Japanese (oil sources) and overseas areas.
						Especially the argument of the export pressure on the raw
						material countries
						points against the reserve in transit questions which Japan showed until
						now. Japan should not
						fear boycott warnings or bring
						<unclear>forth</unclear>
						this fear as an excuse in regard to allowing
						transit businesses for Germany.
					</q>

						Mr. President, I know that several weeks ago former

						personally met him, I would like to ascertain at this time whether or not

					<q xml:id="sp.q.49">I.) The head of the Central Division of the War Ministry,
						General MUTO has informed the Military Attache
						that the Japanese Army would
						welcome it, if Germany were prepared, if need be, to act as mediator in the
						already
						extended conciliatory talks between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, in
						order to conclude the China conflict in a way
						acceptable to Japan. The
						General declared further that Japan is very much interested in Indo-China
						also for this
						reason. The Military Attache promised to forward this, and
						broached the question of Russia's attitude to such a
						development. The
						General replied that the Japanese Army considered conciliation with Russia
						to be necessary. General
						MUTO's inquiry is to be taken as the official
						proposal of the Army, according to Japanese custom.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.50">
						II.) The Minister of Overseas Affairs, General KOISO, asked
						me in a conversation to which he had invited me, what
						Germany's attitude
						would be to the
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06176.jpg" n="6,176" xml:id="pb.29" />
						military activity of Japan in Indo-China and in parts of the Netherlands
						Indies. I pointed to the well-known
						declaration of the Reich Government,
						according to which Germany is not interested in the question of the
						Netherlands Indies and added that we would probably raise no objections to
						Japanese action in Indo-China, provided
						that Japan obliges herself to tie
						down America in the Pacific area, perhaps by a promise to attack the
						Philippines
						and Hawaii in the event of Americas entry into the war against
						Germany. The Minister of Overseas Affairs replied
						that he would be pleased
						to pursue this idea further. Regarding a possible Japanese Non-Aggression
						Pact with Russia,
						the Minister thought that for this Russia would probably
						ask for certain territorial concessions in a northwestern
						province of China
						and Outer-Mongolia, which could be discussed. The Minister admitted that an
						agreement with Russia
						and the realization of Japanese colonial wishes in
						Indo-China and in the Netherlands Indies would not only
						gradually make Japan
						economically independent of America, but would offer to the expected KONOYE
						t Government a
						promising starting point for an agreement with Chiang
						Kai-shek. I have the impression that the ambitious Minister
						of Overseas
						Affairs wanted to qualify himself for the next cabinet by putting out these
						feelers.

						standing behind them and what possibilities result therefrom. My
						impression up to now that the possibility of the
						formation of a Pacific bloc
						of Japan, Chiang Kai-shek China and Russia in association with Germany,
						which ties down
						America in the Pacific sphere and could cripple her freedom

						of the Reich and the Japanese Ambassador,
						SATA, in the presence of
						Ambassador KURUSU and Consul General STAHMER, 8 July 1940.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.55">
						After a word of thanks for the hospitality shown by the
						German Government and congratulations on the victory of
						Germany over France,
						Ambassador SATO declared that just as in Europe the new order would now be
						brought about by
						Germany, Japan on her part had been exerting herself for
						three years to establish a new order in the Far East and
						in the South Seas.
						In these parallel efforts a very close
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06180.jpg" n="6,180" xml:id="pb.33" />
						cooperation between Germany and Japan seems
						to have been in operation. For three years Japan had been holding the
						attention of the English, the French, and the American Governments and
						thereby in a certain sense rendered
						Germany's task in the establishment of
						the new order in Europe easier. In this manner the Governments of both
						countries could mutually support each other.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.56">As far as Soviet Russia was concerned, Japan was under the
						existing circumstances obliged to seek to
						maintain good neighborly relations
						with Russia, just as Germany was also obliged to maintain good relations
						with
						Russia. In this respect also Japan and Germany could cooperate.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.57">
						About America, Ambassador SATO stated that Japan has drawn
						the attention of that country to herself since the
						beginning of the Chinese
						war and that she tied up the American fleet in the Pacific Ocean. It is
						Japan's opinion
						that America must not overstep her zone consisting of North
						and South America and must not intervene in European or
						Far Eastern matters.
						The pursuit of this principle is also in the mutual interest of both
						countries. Ambassador SATO
						closed his remarks by stressing anew the common
						interests of Germany and Japan and the necessity of
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06181.jpg" n="6,181" xml:id="pb.34" />
						their
						cooperation. This cooperation must also encompass economic matters.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.58">In regard to China, Ambassador SATO added that Japan is at
						present putting forth strong endeavors to
						finish the Chinese war, which has
						lasted now for three years, in order to gain free hands. In this connection
						he
						pointed out that public opinion in Japan has "become extraordinarily
						nervous in respect to Indo-China and the Dutch
						East Indies.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.59">
						The REICH FOREIGN MINISTER noted with satisfaction Japan's
						wish to cooperate with Germany in all fields. He
						believed that
						German-Japanese cooperation in itself represented nothing new. He himself
						had been one of those who
						years ago had furthered this cooperation with
						KURUSU's predecessor, General OSHIMA, and it had already borne fruit
						for
						both parties. Germany had made noteworthy use of it in her right for equal
						rights, whilst Japan had doubtless
						drawn considerable advantages throughout
						the whole period of her struggle for China down to the present day from
						the
						existence of a strong Germany. Without the existence of a re-strengthened
						Germany, Japan could not have been
						able to penetrate as deeply into English
						and other spheres of interest in East Asia as it has actually happened.
						The
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06182.jpg" n="6,182" xml:id="pb.35" />
						natural
						interest of both powers in cooperation arises from these facts.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.60">Plans for a very close cooperation between Japan, Germany
						and Italy had already been taken into
						consideration some time before. They
						miscarried because - as appeared again from the latest speeches of Japanese
						statesmen - Japan was not interested in European concerns.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.61">As a result of Germany's Victory over France, a great
						revision in all factors of foreign policy would
						follow. He personally
						believed that in the future, further possibilities for friendly cooperation
						with Japan would
						exist in the framework of the New Order in Europe now
						taking shape. At the present moment he would say nothing of
						the details of
						the form which this cooperation was to take, as he was acquainted with the
						German intentions but not
						with Japan's political aims. He therefore asked
						SATO for a further explanation of the principles of the political
						line which
						Japan proposed to pursue. He would be especially interested to hear from the
						Japanese side what was their
						thought of cooperation with Germany, whether
						only in the economic sphere or in which other way.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.62">
						Ambassador SATO replied that it was
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06183.jpg" n="6,183" xml:id="pb.36" />
						comprehensible
						that for outsiders the Japanese Policy had been difficult to understand. For
						nine years, that is,
						since the outbreak of the Manchurian conflict, Japan
						had been trying to orient her policy in a set direction, but
						had time and
						again subsequently been forced to moderate this new orientation somewhat. In
						regard to the new order in
						the Far East, for Japan it is above all a
						question of permitting a new China to arise with which it could have
						friendly relations. The solidarity between this new China and Japan would
						guarantee peace in the Far East. In order
						to achieve this aim, Japan had for
						several years been fighting obstinately against the so-called regime from
						Washington which finds expression, in the treaties of 1921, especially in
						the Nine Power Pact. This Washington
						regime did not give China and Japan but
						the Anglo-Saxons the predominance in the Far East. Japan did not, however,
						by any means wish to eliminate the foreigners from the Far East. Quite the
						contrary. It also wishes to concede an
						appropriate place to economic
						cooperation with Germany in China.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.63">In its relations with America Japan must of course be very
						careful.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.64">
						To the question of the FOREIGN MINISTER OF THE REICE as to
						what in reality then was the basic
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06184.jpg" n="6,184" xml:id="pb.37" />
						reason for the difficulties between Japan and
						America, SATO answered that this cause lay in the struggle of Japan
						against
						the system of the Nine Power Treaty. In this Japan was not fighting against
						the fundamental principles of
						this treaty. Politically, it was quite
						prepared to respect the independence of China. Economically it was likewise
						in agreement with the so-called principle of the Open Door. It did, however,
						wish to exchange roles and itself be
						the host while the other nations would
						be only guests in East Asia."

						(1) Your conversation with the Foreign Minister Ribbentrop

						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06187.jpg" n="6,187" xml:id="pb.40" />
						Ribbentrop showed you a 'non-commital' attitude concerning Dutch East
						Indies and French Indo-China. Perhaps, he had
						no concern with these
						problems. But did you not disconcern his air to persue something from Japan
						by utilizing Japan
						- for example, Japan's participation in European war?
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.70">You stated that he predicted the world would be divided into
						four Economic Blocks in the future. But,
						did you not receive the impression
						that Germany would not recognize the superiority of a certain stabilizing

						Germany of the French and Dutch colonies in East
						Asia also?

					<q xml:id="sp.q.71">
						(2) While Ribbentrop expressed his optimistic opinion on the
						subject of Japanese-American relation, you spoke of
						the tendency of
						deterioration of Japanese-American relation and you hinted that, if war
						should come to exist between
						the two countries it would cause Germany an
						unfavorable reflection upon her European policy. Did you intend t o
						call his
						attention by saying so, in the sense that the war with the U.S.A. would
						inevitably cause Japan to march on
						to the South Seas and thus bring out
						difficulties in accomplishing German object? Or, did you intend to warn him
						that the war with U.S.A. would have an unfavorable effect
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06188.jpg" n="6,188" xml:id="pb.41" />

						War, if it occurred, would develop into a German-American war? Please reply
						immediately.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.73">(1) It may not necessarily be that Germany does not embrace
						at all a hidden intention to utilize as
						tactics her noncommittal attitude to
						the Japan's demand in relation to Dutch Indies, etc., but, judging from the
						RIBBENTROP's attitude, at least, I did not find such an air to request
						Japan's participation in the war making a
						good use of it as a bait. I felt,
						rather, that Germany did not attach importance to Japan's national power at
						present, excepting her naval power. I cannot, also, say so far that Germany
						has already fostered an ambition on the
						southern colonies. Comparing with
						the days I sent telegram No. 527, today when Germany won the great victory
						in
						European continent, it must not be passed over that pretty large change
						arose in thought of Germany.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.74">
						(2) What I said concerning the problem towards America was
						not intended to restrain Germany's ambition on the South

						Japan's pressure on the
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06190.jpg" n="6,190" xml:id="pb.43" />
						USSR. As seen in my telegram No. 870 and its
						supplementary one, I made RIBBENTROP pay attention, suggesting the
						possible
						development of the U, S.-Japanese war to the U. S.-German war. I talked him
						those, a little in a
						threatening way, supposing the participation of the U.
						S. in the war against Germany might be the great pain to her
						while she was
						engaging in the operations to Britain devotedly and she was endeavoring to
						avoid the long war. I
						guessed what he felt then was just this very weak

						there. Regarding our Soviet policy, which is an important problem to

						ANDO: A plan has been proposed some time ago to the effect
						that Japan should have Germany recognize its free hand
						concerning French
						Indo-China, Dutch East Indies and other South Sea Islands. But as the
						meaning of free hand is
						somewhat vague, if it is expressed more definitely,
						it will be as drafted. I should like to hear your opinion on
						this point. The
						object of this draft is to have Germany understand that Japan has no
						territorial ambition over these
						spheres, but Japan wants to firmly establish
						not only the freedom of economic activities but also political
						leadership.
						In order to have this approved by Germany, it will be necessary to choose a
						form easy for Germany
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06195.jpg" n="6,195" xml:id="pb.48" />
						to approve.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.82">TAKAYAMA:You say you want to make Germany recognize Japan's
						political leadership in the South Seas, but,
						what relation does it have with
						Japan's political leadership in China and Manchuria?
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.83">ANDO: As I regard our political leadership in China and
						Manchuria as a matter of course, I did not
						enumerate it here.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.84">ANDO: Concerning British, French and Dutch territories, we
						will discuss the details later.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.85">ANDO: Concerning German support to the settlement of the
						Chinese Incident, our attitude should be
						absolutely independent. For
						instance, concerning such matters as German mediation of the Chinese
						Incident which has
						recently almost come into question, we should have
						Germany mediate from a point of view that as a part of the
						general problem
						of Japan-German coalition, the quick settlement of the Incident and the
						solidifying of Japan's
						position will become a favorable factor to Germany.
						We should avoid assuming a supplicatory attitude. It is also
						necessary to
						study concretely the recognition of the new regime and the prohibition of
						exports to CHIANG.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.86">
						ANDO: The question of trade with Europe
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06196.jpg" n="6,196" xml:id="pb.49" />
						and Africa and
						on other economic matters has been raised, because, if Germany should resort
						to a closed economy in
						case of forming a block economy in Europe and Africa,
						Japan would fall into difficulties. To meet this problem we
						hope to maintain
						trade between the East Asia and South Seas economic sphere of Japan and the
						new economic sphere of
						Germany, and to make clear whether or not other
						economic relations should exist, as well as the difference /of
						Japan and
						Germany's position in the two spheres/.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.87">ANDO: The most important problem among Japan's promises to
						Germany will be the restraint of British
						activities in East Asia as much as
						possible in order to facilitate Germany's conquest of England (refer to
						Article
						(2)), and on this point I should like to request the Army and the
						Navy to study what practical measures exist. As
						far as I am concerned,
						oppression of British political rights and interests in East Asia or a
						secret assistance to
						the native independence movements in India and Burma,
						in accordance with the changes in the situation, may serve as
						restraining
						measures.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.88">
						ANDO: Point 3 specifies compensation for Germany's

						will supply Germany with them. We will also give favorable

						Germany's economic activities (including investment and enterprises) in
						China and the South Seas.
						(a) and (b) will keep an even balance.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.89">ONO: After the conclusion of the war there may be occasions
						when Germany might carry out active economic
						operations towards the Dutch
						East Indies, French Indo-China, and China, and especially after Germany
						makes France
						and the Netherlands somewhat like subject states, it is
						probable that she will dispatch active members of the Nazi
						Party to French
						Indo-China and the Dutch Fast Indies and keep these two colonies under her
						political leadership even
						if she would not go so far as to make them her own
						territories. Therefore, Japan's policy toward French Indo-China
						and the
						Dutch East Indies must be hastened in order to prevent such movement /on the
						part of Germany/ and she must
						also endeavour to sever French Indo-China and
						the Dutch East Indies from European influence as soon as possible.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.90">
						ANDO: As to our Soviet policy referred to in (2), it is
						equally favorable to both Japan and Germany to maintain
						peace with the
						Soviet Union
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06198.jpg" n="6,198" xml:id="pb.51" />
						at present. However, we cannot forecast to what direction Germany will turn
						its relations with Soviet after
						cessation of the European War. It will he
						necessary for us to make some sort of arrangement with Germany beforehand
						as
						Japan and Germany will he in the same position in their relations with
						Soviet. However, the relation between
						Germany and Soviet at the present
						moment is delicate, and there probably may be something which Germany cannot
						tell
						us unreservedly. For this reason, the latter part of article (2) may be
						dropped according to circumstances.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.91">TAKAYAMA: Germany would not like to see Soviet penetrate

						check Soviet in the East, what
						measures could be considered?

						II.

				<sp xml:id="sp.83">
					<q xml:id="sp.q.93">
						TAKAYAMA: Does this mean that Japan will not try to reach
						any particular understanding with the United States after
						all? For example,
						if such an agreement as to guarantee the peace of the Pacific should be
						reached, and if the United
						States should, as a consequence, no longer sense
						menace in the Pacific, it may interfere with European affairs,
						which
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06199.jpg" n="6,199" xml:id="pb.52" />
						Germany will
						no doubt detest.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.94">ANDO: No! Even if such an agreement should be reached, the
						agreement will be made in a manner that the
						United States will confine
						itself to the American continents and it will not interfere with the affairs
						of the South
						Seas and other parts of the world. Recently, Hitler propounded
						that the United States should mind its own business
						of the American
						continents and should not interfere with the affairs of other continents,
						and RIBBENTROP, in his
						conversation with our Ambassador SATO, did not seem
						to hope for the impairment of Japanese-American relation to
						restrain the
						United States, Apparently, Germany's wish is to maintain a peaceful relation
						with the United States at
						present and in the future, as long as the latter
						does not take an offensive attitude. Consequently, Germany is not
						likely to
						hope for the impairment of Japanese-American relation.
					</q>

					<q xml:id="sp.q.96">ANDO:Such anxiety was felt in the early stage of the present

					<q xml:id="sp.q.97">ISHIZAWA:There is one thing that we should keep in our mind
						in respect of our relation with the United

						must
						necessarily check it together.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.99">
						ISHIZAWA:Judging from each assertion made by Japan and the
						United States, there is a considerable difference in
						opinions between the
						two, and it will require unusual efforts to adjust it. On the other hand,
						upon the
						establishment of the New Order in Europe, the United States will
						find it difficult to interfere in European
						affairs, and as a consequence, it
						will intervene in Far Eastern affairs, with the Philippines and Hawaii as
						its
						naval bases. Should a peaceful order be established between Japan and
						the United States,
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06201.jpg" n="6,201" xml:id="pb.54" />
						the latter may insist upon pretty severe conditions to

						the United
						States, we may turn out to be a liability to Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.100">ANDO: However, should the United States put pressure upon
						Japan, Japan's power of restraining Soviet may
						be weakened, and Germany
						would not like it. So Japan's relations with the United States and Soviet
						and that of
						Germany will eventually become the same.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.101">TAKAYAMA: Germany has considerably advanced into South
						America since pre-war time, and won't it be as

						Germany to advance to South America after the war as well? If so, the United

						not approve of this movement and don't you think a conflict

					<q xml:id="sp.q.102">
						SHIBA: According to Helfrich who recently visited Japan, it
						was said that, contrary to Japan's erroneous

						power which had expanded during and before the war would undertake great
						economic
						activities in order to extend the market for German industrial

						iii) to have harmony in economy and

						between Japan and Germany.

						States from interfering with affairs outside
						the American continent, end if
						the United States should put political or economic pressure either upon
						Japan or
						Germany, both Germany and Japan must not adopt such a policy as

					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.148">In order to facilitate Britain's surrender Japan shall
						check her as far as possible in East Asia by such
						measures as the withdrawal
						of British forces, demand for the disarmament of Hongkong (Singapore),
						demand for the
						cession of British territories in the South Seas,
						independence of India, Burma and others, capture of British
						ships. For this
						end, Germany shall give adequate political support for disposition of the
						China Incident.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.160">ANTO (Foreign Office) utters:For today, I request Army and
						Navy to give us their opinions concerning the
						plan (proposal) relating to
						the intensification of coalition among Japan, Germany and Italy which I gave
						you on the
						occasion of the previous conference. Please start with Army.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.161">
						TAKAYAMA (War Ministry):I agree upon this plan as a whole
						and will give you our opinion in details as to the
						meaning of the word NANYO
						/T.N. South Seas/ contained in the phrase 'the construction
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06215.jpg" n="6,215" xml:id="pb.68" />
						of a new order
						in the Far East including the South Seas,' mentioned in clause 1, I would
						like to have it mean as
						Japan's intention to include the territory extending
						from Burma and the eastern part of India on the west to
						Australia and New
						Zealand on the east, but since there should be a South Seas of first sense
						and also of the second
						sense, the South Seas to be expressed as Japan's
						attitude for the present should be a narrower South Seas excluding
						Australia, New Zealand and Burma. Nevertheless, I think we should consider
						as Japan's attitude the NANYO of the
						wider sense.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.162">ANTO (Foreign Office): As Japan's ideal, Australia, New
						Zealand and Burma, of course, should be
						included, but as a concrete question
						we should adopt the South Seas of the first sense for the time being. In
						regard to this point, I am wholly in agreement with Lt. Col. TAKAYAMA.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.163">SHIBA (Naval Ministry):I agree to that.</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.164">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, in regard to the outline of
						clause (2), I wonder if it isn't necessary to
						discuss the point that is to
						become the basis of the outline, that is the fundamental point, before the
						outline is
						decided with Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.165">
						ANTO (Foreign Office): Since the fundamental
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06216.jpg" n="6,216" xml:id="pb.69" />
						point is that
						since both countries are on a common footing -- that is, the establishment
						of a new order in Europe
						and Africa by Germany as her sphere of livelihood
						and the establishment of a new order in East Asia, including the
						South Seas,
						by Japan as her' sphere of livelihood, does it mean that both countries
						should recognize and respect
						each other's sphere and assist and cooperate in
						the establishment of the new order within the respective sphere?
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.166">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Yes.</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.167">ANTO (Foreign Ministry): I have no objection to the opinion
						of Lt, Colonel TAKAYAMA in regard to
						settling the fundamental point with
						Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.168">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): That is, in regard to discussing
						this matter with Germany, the outline and
						details should be entered into
						only after the fundamental point has been discussed first.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.169">ANTO (Foreign Ministry):I agree with you. </q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.170">(Navy agrees)</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.171">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, let us go into the contents
						of the outline. In clause 1, there is a
						phrase 'not to interfere with the
						self-government and independence of the various races,' but I believe it is
						not
						necessary to make Germany express this.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.172">
						ANTO (Foreign Office): It is there for the purpose of
						showing that Germany has no intention of
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06217.jpg" n="6,217" xml:id="pb.70" />
						acquiring these territories.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.173">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I don't think it is necessary to
						make her say it distinctly. I wonder if it
						would not be sufficient if we
						make her recognize the fact that French Indo-China and Dutch Indies are
						within the
						sphere of livelihood of Japan and Japan's political leadership in
						these areas. After all, it will be 'recognize the
						fact that the South Seas
						area is within the sphere of livelihood of Japan.'
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.174">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, the question is about the
						meaning of political leadership. The strongest
						meaning of this is
						occupation, but we are not thinking of occupation at present. Anyway, it is
						necessary that the
						whole country conspire and unite on the point of
						political leadership and make Germany recognize as strong a
						political
						leadership as possible.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.175">
						ANTO (Foreign Office): I think here lies one of the most
						difficult points in regard to the question of
						intensification of this
						problem. As seen hazily by the cable from Ambassador SATO, isn't it the
						intention of Germany
						to grasp the political leadership for herself and give
						Japan only the economic interest in regard to French
						Indo-China and
						Netherlands East Indies, In other words, it appears
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06218.jpg" n="6,218" xml:id="pb.71" />
						as if Germany
						will not recognize Japan's right of political leadership.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.176">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I feel that way myself, and it is
						necessary to force Germany to recognize as
						strong a leadership as possible
						of French Indo-China and the Dutch Indies.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.177">ANTO (Foreign Office): I think this point will be the first
						thing argued when the talk on the question
						of intensification of this matter
						is taken up, but according to the cable from Consul-General YAMAJI, the
						other day,
						Germany reportedly is willing to offer Japan the eastern part of
						the Dutch Indies, In another sense, it means that
						Germany is taking Java,
						Sumatra, etc.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.178">
						TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): As to what attitude Germany will
						take towards Japan in future concerning the Dutch Indies
						and French
						Indo-China depends largely upon the attitude she will take towards Soviet
						Russia after the war. Since
						Germany has no intention to dispose of Russia
						immediately after the war, she might leave French Indo-China and the
						Dutch
						Indies to Japan easier than expected. But if she were to start with the
						construction of a new order in Europe,
						the question of French Indo-China and
						Dutch Indies will become considerably troublesome.
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06219.jpg" n="6,219" xml:id="pb.72" />
						And as for
						Japan, she should, for the time being, consider that Germany has the
						intention of politically taking over
						French Indo-China and the Dutch Indies
						and should be prepared for it. For that, a considerably firm determination
						is necessary.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.179">ANTO (Foreign Office): I agree with you. We should object
						strongly to Germany's intention to assume
						political leadership in Dutch
						Indies, etc.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.180">ISHIZAWA (Foreign Ministry): I agree completely.</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.181">TANEMURA (General Staff Office):I think the question of
						French Indo-China and Dutch East Indies depends
						entirely upon naval power
						and Germany, who has no naval power, will not be able to oppose Japan within
						the sphere of
						Japanese naval influence no matter how stoutly she may resist.
						Consequently, the question lies solely in Japan's
						determination.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.182">ANTO (Foreign Office): I think you are right, but Germany,
						in such an event, might try to utilize Russia
						and check Japan from the
						north. This, too, is a point to be taken into consideration.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.183">
						TANEMURA (General Staff Office): I don't think that even
						Soviet Russia would be a tool of Germany and carelessly
						meddle into this
						with the hope of securing the northern section of Manchuria.
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06220.jpg" n="6,220" xml:id="pb.73" />
						Soviet Russia
						would probably seek for the Near East and India.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.184">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): How about setting aside (B) 'to
						assume a means of checking to expedite the
						surrender of England' as a
						separate clause, together with foregoing clause 'to give appropriate support
						for the
						disposition of the China incident This is because it is a current
						problem or a matter to be concluded in a short
						period rather than one that
						will regulate the future relation between Japan and Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.185">ANTO (Foreign Office): As this was considered as a
						recompensation for Germany in return for recognition
						of the New Order in
						East Asia including the South Seas and for her support in the disposition of
						the Incident, there
						is no reason for any objection against making it a
						separate clause.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.186">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): It is stated that a restraining
						measure will be taken against England, but I
						wonder if there is any really
						effective restraining measure?
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.187">SHIBA (Naval Ministry): It's very difficult as a concrete
						plan.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.188">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Then, is it not necessary to
						change the working of this clause?
					</q>
					<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06221.jpg" n="6,221" xml:id="pb.74" />
					<q xml:id="sp.q.189">TAJIRI (Foreign Office): The newspapers can be
						utilized.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.190">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): The checking of England by Japan
						and Germany's support for the disposition of
						the incident can be regarded as
						balancing each other, and in regard to the recognition of the new regime to
						be
						considered in connection with the disposition of the incident, the
						balance can be obtained by the recognition of
						Poland and so forth, but in
						regard to obtaining her cooperation in the economic construction of China, I
						wonder if
						the check against England can't be regarded as its balance?
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.191">ANTO (Foreign Office): As compensation for her cooperation
						in the economic construction, the supplying
						of wolfram and other things,
						which Germany wants, and her participation in the enterprise to some extent
						can be
						considered.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.192">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I think we should refrain from
						allowing her to participate in the enterprises
						in China as much as
						possible.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.193">TANEMURA (General Staff Office): In case of the worst, we
						should show our generosity of allowing her to
						participate in as much as half
						of the enterprises.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.194">
						TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): We do that, I
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06222.jpg" n="6,222" xml:id="pb.75" />
						want that to
						be restricted to the minimum.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.195">TAJIRI (Foreign Office): As for Germany's political support
						in connection with the disposition of the
						incident, it probably is her peace
						mediation for the time being. In regard to the economic problem, it is
						cooperation in economy and technique, and as compensation, we can give
						Germany's heavy industries markets in China
						and the South Seas.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.196">TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): There is a necessity to consider
						Italy together with Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.197">TAJIRI (Foreign Ministry):As compensation, Germany has been
						conducting coastal trade since the outbreak
						of the incident, and I believe
						it better to recognize such things as this coastal trade and industrial
						technical
						assistance. I wonder if it isn't necessary for Japan to learn
						economic technique from Germany.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.198">ANTO (Foreign Office):It's necessary. America's heavy
						industry is rich in materials. In other words, it
						is a heavy industry of the
						rich and Germany's is that of the poor. As for Japan, it is necessary for
						her to learn
						Germany's poor man's heavy industry.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.199">
						TANEMURA (General Staff Office):For Japan, it is extremely
						important for her to develop the heavy

						not

					<q xml:id="sp.q.243">
						What the entire mankind longs for is the firm establishment

						can never endure

						Unfortunately,
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06234.jpg" n="6,234" xml:id="pb.87" />
						however, the establishment of world peace in this sense is difficult of
						speedy realization at the present stage of
						human progress. In order to
						realize such a great ideal, therefore, it seems to be a most natural step
						that peoples
						who are closely related with each other geographically,
						racially, culturally and economically should first form a
						sphere of their
						own co-existence and co-prosperity and establish peace and order within that
						sphere, and at the same
						time secure a relationship of common existence and
						prosperity with other spheres. The cause of strifes mankind has
						hitherto
						experienced lies generally in the failure to give due consideration to the
						necessity of some such natural
						and constructive world order and to remedy
						the irrationalities and injustices of old. The war in Europe brings home
						the
						truth of this with special emphasis. Therefore, in order to establish
						international peace on a permanent
						foundation every effort must be exerted
						for the rectification of the blunders that have been committed in this
						regard.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.244">
						It is in this spirit that Japan is now engaged in the task

						principle, but
						on the contrary, obstruct the establishment of peace in East Asia by
						supporting the regime of Chiang
						Kai-shek. We have urged them to reconsider

						eradicate all activities for assisting

						<corr>therefore</corr>
						. It is for the purpose of bringing about a

						was submitted to the Premier, who
						summoned the War Minister this morning, and telling him that the army's idea
						was

						bluntly to
						resign in case of inconvenience. Thereupon the War Minister at once

					<q xml:id="sp.q.291">Premier YONAI came to Hayama from Tokyo at 6:40 P.M. and

						although the selection of a successor was not being refused, it was
						difficult to choose one and no forecast was
						possible.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.292">Premier YONAI in announcing to the Cabinet his decision in

						usual in the past call each

						the members in
						the cabinet meeting room and stating first that this was not
						a cabinet meeting, expressed his decision. At this,

						scowled, but straightway stood up and made a speech. That is the story.

					<q xml:id="sp.q.303">Lord Privy Seal--I don't know the details but the gist of

						YONAI yesterday at HAYAMA is as
						follows: The Army thinks that the present cabinet is not adequate to carry
						out a
						policy Which will suit the present ever-changing world situation and
						which will not be regretted later. It seems to
						show also a tendency to favor
						a political reapproachment with Germany and Italy. It also feels that even
						in domestic
						affairs the government, being separated from the people, will be
						unable to obtain satisfactory results in a number
						of policies, and that
						unless the political structure is strengthened, the government will be
						unable to cope with the
						present emergency. In a word since the War
						Minister's opinion is different from that of the present cabinet, he
						cannot
						fulfill his duty as the leader of the Army. Hence he has come to the point
						of resigning.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.304">
						WAKATSUKI:I feel that there is no one fit
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06251.jpg" n="6,251" xml:id="pb.104" />
						for the
						Premier's post at this time except Prince KONOYE. I hope Prince KONOYE will
						take the field.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.305">HARA:It would be fine if Prince KONOYE took the field.</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.306">HIRANUMA, HAYASHI, OKADA: We quite agree with Baron
						WAKATSUKI's opinion.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.307">Prince KONOYE: In view of the circumstances leading to the
						general resignation of the YONAI cabinet, the
						one to take charge of the
						present situation should be well versed in military affairs with a full
						understanding of
						them. As I do not have such ability, and have made no
						preparations for it, I would like to see someone more fit for
						the post
						selected.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.308">Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal:I have heard that the views
						of the military leaders are overwhelmingly in
						favor of Prince KONOYE's
						taking the field. Besides, there are points in the present actions of the
						army which may be
						understood as having been based on the assumption that
						Prince KONOYE would rise. I do not think that there is any
						other person fit
						for the post. I earnestly hope that Prince KONOYE will come forward.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.309">
						HIRANUMA: It is a bad example that the cabinet should fall
						on account of the War Minister's resignation, and it is
						regretabble that we
						have often
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06252.jpg" n="6,252" xml:id="pb.105" />
						had such examples. It should be that a successor would be found and the
						cabinet be able to continue. However,
						because in practice the custom has
						come-about of having the three chiefs make the recommendation, such
						situations as
						today's arise. It is reasonable that Prince KONOYE is
						concerned over this point, and I feel sorry for him having to
						take the field
						at this time. However, since we cannot find anyone else fit for the post,
						there is nothing for it but
						to earnestly ask Prince KONOYE to come forward.
						Moreover, since we are in this difficult position it is needless to
						say that
						every quarter not to speak of ourselves should endeavor to make it easy for
						the Prince to manage his task.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.310">
						HIROTA: It seems the China Incident cannot be easily
						settled if the cabinet is as weak as it has been, and there is
						no other way
						but to continue the present state of affairs. Judged from this view point,
						it would also be a good
						thing to have a suitable military man capable of
						working closely with the Army and Navy. However, there is no such
						man.
						Besides, since the military themselves wish it there is no problem about
						asking Prince KONOYE to take the
						field. Lately we have had all kinds of
						rumors. The
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06253.jpg" n="6,253" xml:id="pb.106" />
						Lord Privy Seal must have made quite an investigation of them.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.311">Lord Privy Seal: AS I have said before, according to the
						information we have received, various rumors
						are prevailing, but generally
						speaking, there is a strong hope that Prince KONOYE will take the field.
						Also at this
						time when the enc of the China Incident is gradually
						approaching, I feel that a large section of the public is of
						the opinion
						that there is no suitable person other than Prince KONOYE to form a strong
						cabinet.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.312">Lord Privy Seal: I can easily see that you generally agree
						upon Prince KONOYE. After consulting the
						Elder Statesman, KIDO will report
						the reply to the throne.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.313">
						Things took place as I have noted and the meeting was
						closed at 1:30 p.m. I sent Chief Secretary MATSUKAIRA to
						OKITSU by the 3:00
						p.m. train to see Prince SAIONJI. Their Majesties returned from HAYAMA at
						5:10 p.m. At 6:36 Chief
						Secretary MATSUDAIRA telephoned me from Prince
						SAIONJI's villa at OKITSU that as the old prince was not only sick
						at that
						time but also knew little of the political situation, he could not take the
						responsibility of replying to
						the throne. So I answered that I understood. I
						was
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06254.jpg" n="6,254" xml:id="pb.107" />
						received
						in audience by His Majesty at 7:00 p.m. I informed Him of the result of the
						meeting and of Prince SAIONJI's
						reply. Although Prince SAIONJI's reply to
						the throne was inevitable because of advanced age, His Majesty in order
						to
						show his respect wishes to ask the Elder statesman hereafter also. However,
						as I felt sorry to see the GENRO
						pressed for a reply, I asked the Emperor to
						call Prince KONOYE leaving that matter as it was. His Majesty gladly
						accepted my request. Accordingly the Emperor had the Grand Chamberlain
						summon Prince KONOYE by telephone. Again I
						was received in audience by His
						Majesty. I reported the details of this afternoon's meeting. At that time
						the
						Emperor spoke as follows:
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.314">'When War Minister HATA came to HAYAMA today to report to
						the throne on personnel, he told me what the
						opinion of the army is.
						Generally it was the same as that which KIDO had heard from HONAI yesterday.
						I told him that
						this business was very regrettable, but I felt it was one
						consolation that we could see where the responsibility
						lay, although there
						had been up till now many uncertain attitudes. HATA, who was once Chief
						Aide-de-Camp and who
						knows how busy I am at such times, was extremely sorry
						and had tears in his eyes.'

					<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06255.jpg" n="6,255" xml:id="pb.108" />
					<q xml:id="sp.q.315">I retired from the Imperial presence at 7:40 p.m. On that
						occasion the Emperor asked me whether he might
						give KONOYE some advice, it
						being of a simple matter, which KIDO also had once mentioned. That is, that
						KONOYE
						should be prudent especially in the choice of Foreign and Finance
						Ministers at this time when the situation at home
						and abroad is grave.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.316">Of course I replied that it would be a good idea to do
						so.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.317">
						Prince KONOYE came to the Imperial Palace at eight. After
						having talked with me for a short time, he went into the
						Imperial presence
						and received the Imperial command. I am told that on that occasion the
						Emperor gave him the
						foregoing advice. He, after having retired from the
						Imperial presence, again talked with me. He told me that he
						would go to the
						Peers' Club after that on that day and would invite the War and Navy
						Ministers. He intends to ask
						the War Minister to select a person who can
						cooperate with the Navy and the Navy Minister, to choose a person who
						can
						cooperate with the Army. He will wait till the selection is made and on the
						next day or the day following will
						have the Foreign Minister join them for a
						full discussion of national defense, diplomacy, cooperation between Army
						and
						Navy and the
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06256.jpg" n="6,256" xml:id="pb.109" />
						relation between the Supreme Command and the Government. And only after they
						come to an agreement in their views
						will he begin selecting the other
						Cabinet Ministers. He said that he wished to have KOREMATSU as his secretary
						and
						asked me to use my influence for that purpose. He left at 8:40.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.318">I was summoned by His Majesty and received in audience at
						8:45. I reported on Prince KONOYE's policy in
						regard to the formation of the
						cabinet. The Emperor seemed to be satisfied with it. I retired from the
						Imperial
						presence at 9:10. I reached home at 9:30. I received a treatment

					<q xml:id="sp.q.333">Went to the Imperial Villa at 2 p.m. in response to the
						Emperor's request and was received in audience
						at 2:15. Was asked by the
						Emperor whether an order (which had been secretly resorted by the Prince,
						the Chief of the
						General Staff, for heavy artillery mobilization for the
						purposes of the South China campaign) had been fully
						cleared with the
						Government. I replied that I would ask the Chief Aide-de-Camp to inquire of
						the War Minister
						regarding the liason on this matter, and if the liaison had
						not been sufficient, I myself would ask the Premier.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.334">Left the Emperor then and at once got in touch with the

					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.335">
						Learned from the Aide-de-Camp that he had heard as follows
						from the War Ministers At the Four Ministers' Conference
						on the 12th (which
						the Finance Minister was specially invited to attend) the results of a
						careful study were that
						since in any case any preparations at all would
						require a month and a half, they had agreed to push preparations.
						It was
						decided at a cabinet meeting that a further cabinet decision
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06260.jpg" n="6,260" xml:id="pb.113" />
						would be
						required if actual operations were undertaken. After inquiring by phone as
						to Foreign Minister ARITA's
						opinion and receiving the same sort of answer as
						that from the War Minister, I reported in person to the Emperor to
						the above
						effect at four o'clock, and the Emperor was pleased to hear my reply.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.336">At that time the Emperor said one thing and another about
						the change in the government. He said that he
						still today had faith in the
						YONAI Cabinet, and that though a change of Cabinet was inevitable in view of
						domestic
						and foreign conditions, he wished to have his feelings conveyed to
						YONAI. I said that I would arrange to have the

					<q xml:id="sp.q.363">
						The world is now on the threshold of a stupendous historic
						change. New political, economic and cultural orders are
						in the process of
						creation on the basis of the growth and development of several groups of
						nations. Japan is also
						faced by a great ordeal unparalleled in history. At
						this juncture,
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06272.jpg" n="6,272" xml:id="pb.125" />
						if we are to carry out a national policy truly in consonance with the
						lofty ideal on which our nation is founded,
						it is of the most urgent
						necessity to effect a fundamental renovation of the government
						administration along all
						lines, and to march forward toward the completion
						of a national defence structure, by surmounting all difficulties.
						The
						general principles of the basic national policy have been therefore
						formulated as follows:
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.364">1. Basic Policy.</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.365">
						The fundamental aim of Japan's national policy lies in the
						establishment of world peace in accordance with the
						lofty ideal of
						<hi rend="underlined">Hakko Ichiu</hi>
						on which the Empire is founded. First
						of all, it is directed toward the construction of a new order of Greater
						East
						Asia built upon a firm solidarity of Japan, Manchoukuo and China with
						this Empire as the center. We will therefore
						speedily secure for herself an
						unshakable national structure such as conforms to the new world situation
						and march
						forward toward the realization of the national policy by
						mobilizing the total strength of the nation.

						execution of national policy on
						the basis of a state structure for national
						defense through manifestation of the nation's total strength.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.368">The fundamental aim of Japan's foreign policy at present

						be focussed upon a successful settlement of the China Affair, while, by

						longrange view of the great world change, constructive and elastic
						measures will be adopted in order to advance the
						national fortunes of the
						Empire.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.369">3. Renovation of the Internal Structure.</q>

						The Japanese Ambassador, with whom I carried out current
						business today, in the end brought the talk to the role
						that the new
						Japanese cabinet would have to play in big politics. KURUSU declared from
						the beginning that he had not
						yet received any instructions from his new
						government; he was of the belief that they should not wait too long for
						the
						definition of the general lines of the new Japanese foreign policy, For his,
						KURUSU's, own
						<unclear>world</unclear>
						two methods could be considered:
						either he is to wait until his government gives him instructions, or he is
						to take
						up a position in accordance with the outlook here so as to advise
						his government, before it firmly fixes its
						position. In both cases a talk
						with us is necessary whether it be with the Foreign Minister of the Reich or
						with me.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.390">
						The Ambassador did not go into details but gave some of his
						own observations which might correspond
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06279.jpg" n="6,279" xml:id="pb.132" />
						to his personal view of the situation. He
						believed that Japanese politics must now be orientated by taking a long
						view. Apparently KURUSU is not thinking of a speedy end to the war and
						reckons at any rate on a state of tension
						which has to he estimated to last
						for years in which the relations of Japan with Russia and the USA are
						naturally
						most important. The Ambassador told me that he is conscious of the
						fact that the Foreign Minister of the Reich had
						suggested repeatedly to
						Japan agreement with Russia. Such an action as well as the Japanese attitude
						towards USA
						should be harmonized with the German and also Italian
						intentions. The Ambassador reminded of the fact that the
						Reichs Foreign
						Minister, on the occasion of the visit of Minister SATO, had pictured the
						German-Japanese friendship
						and cooperation as being very important.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.391">
						Nevertheless, he, KURUSU, did not know exactly how this
						cooperation is pictured by us in detail, especially if and
						at what time we
						wish to see the Japanese weight thrown on the scale of the present conflict.
						If, for instance, Japan
						would push, on her part, towards a war and enter
						into the war against America, while, on the other hand, Germany
						believed the
						end of the war near, expecting a quick victory, Japan would, probably, be
						acting contrary to German
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06280.jpg" n="6,280" xml:id="pb.133" />
						wishes. If, however, Japan would not intervene now,
						the factor Japan, and, especially her fleet, in the triangle
						Berlin-Rome-Tokyo would by all means have great potentialities in the
						future.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.392">I had the feeling that KURUSU expects of the new course in
						Tokyo a tendency towards intervention in the
						war but wished to hear from me,
						that this /intervention/ would not be quite timely according to German
						opinion.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.393">The Ambassador would certainly be grateful if he could
						obtain a hint in the near future - either through
						the Reichs Foreign
						Minister personally or through me - as to which advice he should give his
						government. He is clear
						about the fact that this advice must fully lie
						within the framework of the German-Japanese policy of friendship. He
						may not
						be quite certain, however, whether we still regard the Japanese-Russian
						rapprochement as equally important
						as hitherto and whether the new Japanese
						Cabinet should follow its anti-Anglo-Saxon course with an accelerated or,
						possibly, at first with a moderate speed.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.394">
						Fundamentally, I just accepted the statements of the
						Ambassador and did not anticipate a reply, to be given to
						them. I opposed
						his opinion
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06281.jpg" n="6,281" xml:id="pb.134" />

						OTT also touches this subject in his telegraphic
						report, but KURUSU repeated
						MATSUOKA's statements in greater detail, in the following way: Japan wants
						to organize
						the East Asia sphere, including the South Seas, on a broad
						basis. MATSUOKA mentioned to OTT that Japan wants to
						create in this area a
						situation in which there would be no conquest, no oppression, and no
						exploitation. Everybody
						should come to his rights there. Japan for her part
						would adhere to these three basic principles, but would then
						expect that no
						European or American country would violate these principles. The matter
						concerns itself with ideals,
						which if correctly understood, lie in the
						common interest. KURUSU named Japan, Manchukuo, and China as the core of
						the
						Great East Axis sphere, for which he used the term East Asia 'Axis'.

						must know the fact as well
						as Your Excellency knows it, that I am one of the
						proposers and originators of the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern
						pact. Later,
						when the problem of the Japanese-German Military Alliance occurred, you saw
						my attitude and I think it
						is unnecessary to explain neither my feeling nor
						my standpoint for Germany and Italy repeatedly. As you may find
						out easily,
						both the government and the people have inclined to strengthen the power of
						the Axis, but it is not
						decided yet in the cabinet council. I cannot
						persuade Premier KONOYE and other members of the cabinet, unless I
						know at
						least the outline of Germany's intention or attitude to the thought I
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06287.jpg" n="6,287" xml:id="pb.140" />
						embrace
						before it will be carried out. In other words, I am very anxious to know

						can hardly carry it out.'

						MATSUOKA: 'I hate, as you know, to use diplomatic or
						suggestive terms and I may express my thought freely. Japan is
						intending to
						establish a new order of Greater East Asia, as made already public by the
						Japanese Government, in a
						circle of Japan, Manchoukuo and China including
						the South Seas, and wishes the liberation and freedom of all
						nations and
						races in the sphere, and thus is planning to increase their mutual and
						common profit aiming at
						co-prosperity. Speaking in the other way, I oppose
						subjugation and exploitation. I object to them even if made by
						Japan. Of
						course, some Japanese may be planning to subjugate and exploit these
						regions, but they are taught to do so
						by some Europeans and Americans, and
						so, they are those influenced by America and Europe. I oppose absolutely
						these
						means whether they might be done by Japanese or European and American
						powers. I have determined to resist and
						dispute if Japan would dare
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06288.jpg" n="6,288" xml:id="pb.141" />
						to commit
						such deeds. There are fairly many Japanese who have the same opinion as
						mine, that is, to wish all the
						people to get mutual and common advantages
						and to attain mutual prosperity. Japan does not refuse to have these
						regions
						entered by Europeans and Americans, nor will expel them from the sphere. I
						believe this very principle will
						bring immediately a large profit to
						Americans and Europeans too. You may have some doubt in what I said,
						surveying
						the present China Incident superficially, but if enough time is
						given, Japan will realize surely this idea as well
						in China.
					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.410">
						'Now, as I believe, Japan can manage by herself in what
						concerns China, and I didn't question Germany about it. But
						I would like to
						know what attitude Germany will assume towards the aforecited Japanese ideal
						or course on the South
						Seas? What will Germany want to gain in the South
						Seas? And what does Germany want and what can it do as regards
						Russo-Japanese relations? As for the American-Japanese relations, I always
						think the future world civilization will
						belong to the Pacific civilization
						in which, I believe, both Japan and America will play great roles, and so
						the
						relation between both countries is an important matter affecting a
						serious influence on tomorrow's human beings. I
						wish to know what Germany
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06289.jpg" n="6,289" xml:id="pb.142" />
						wishes to
						do toward what she can do and what she requests of America or Japan from
						this overall viewpoint. But,
						excepting this for the present, as it is a too
						large and too distant a problem I want to know what Germany wishes
						to do
						towards America and what she can do for the sake of Japan in the present
						situation in the relation between
						Japan and America which you well
						know.'

					<q xml:id="sp.q.413">
						OTT: 'This is my personal opinion too. As to the South
						Seas, Germany has three big viewpoints. Germany is now in
						the war against
						Great Britain, but there is a possibility of developing into a war against
						whole British Empire (war
						of destroying the British Empire) in the future.
						The South Seas, for Germany, must be seen from this point of view.
						This is
						(1) Germany must consider what should be done for her, with the South Seas,
						when the war develops to such
						conditions, (2) just what
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06290.jpg" n="6,290" xml:id="pb.143" />
						things and
						how much should be necessary to be required, (3) after all, the problem
						depends upon the German attitude
						of how to settle and how to keep her with
						Japan and the South Seas. Looking from such a broad
						<pb facs="TR03.19460924.06291.jpg" n="6,291" xml:id="pb.144" />
						standpoint at
						the war against Britain, the China Incident is simply an incident, isn't it?
						And I think, too, apart

					</q>
					<q xml:id="sp.q.414">MATSUOKA:'I think I can agree with the last part of your

						that fact to a magazine. At
						present, as you know, most of our people regard the China Incident as one of
						the most
						urgent matters to be settled. I, as Foreign Minister, cannot help
						considering the opinion of our people. The China
						Incident forms a part of

						1. The Government announces an extensive revirement of the

						representatives in Hungary,
						Spain, Finland, Bulgaria, Rumania, Argentina,
						Egypt, Canada, besides them five embassy councillors among them the

						Hamburg, and Prague. The Foreign Minister declared to the press, that this
						action
						had become necessary in order to secure the new foreign policy
						introduced by him and to bring the Japanese Foreign
						Service into
						coordination with the new Japanese conditions. For this reason it is also
						necessary to replace most of
						the division heads of the Foreign Ministry with
						new personalities. Publication of these changes will soon take
						place. The
						whole press of today is governed by this radical and, in Japanese history,
						unique revirement, which is
						called a 'coup d'Etat' in several papers. The
						drastic action of the government evidently intends in the first place
						to
						render harmless the exponents of pro-Anglo-Saxon courses. This is also
