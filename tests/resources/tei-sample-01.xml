        Journal of Trip from Cooper Creek Towards Adelaide  </head>

				<p>The Advance party 
        of the <orgName>VEE</orgName>, consisting of <persName>Burke</persName>
					<persName>Wills</persName> and <persName>King</persName> (<name>Gray</name> being dead) having 
        returned from Carpentaria on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> April 1861 in an exhausted 
        and weak state and finding that the Depôt Party left at <geogName>Cooper Creek</geogName> had 
        started for the Darling with their horses and Camels fresh and in good 
        condition, deemed it useless to attempt to overtake them, having only 
        two Camels, both done up, and being so weak themselves as to be unable 
        to walk more than four or five miles a day. Finding also that the provisions 
        left at the Depôt for them would scarcely take them to Meninda, started 
        down Cooper Creek for Adelaide, via 
        <geogName ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hopeless_%28South_Australia%29">Mt Hopeless</geogName> 
        on the morning of April 
        23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> 1861, intending to follow as nearly as possible the route 
        taken by Gregory.  by so doing they hoped to be able to recruit themselves 
        &amp; the Camels whilst sauntering slowly down the Creek and 
        to have sufficient provisions left to take them comfortably or at least 
        without risk to some station in South Australia.</p>

				<p>Their equipment consists 
        of the following articles:</p>

				<p>As we were about to 
        start this morning some blacks came by from whom we were fortunate enough 
        to get about twelve pounds of fish for a few pieces of straps and some 
        matches &amp;c this is a great treat for us as well as a valuable addition 
        to our rations.  We started at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>8 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>15pm on our way 
        down the Creek the Blacks going in the opposite direction, little thinking 
        that in a few miles they would be able to get lots pieces for nothing 
        better than those they had obtained from us.</p>

				<p>Awoke at five oclock 
        after a most refreshing nights rest.  the sky was beautifully clear and 
        the air rather chilly the terrestrial radiation seems to have been considerable 
        and a slight dew had fallen.</p>
			
				<p>We had scarcely finished 
        breakfast when when [sic] our friends the Blacks from whom we obtained 
        the fish, made their appearance with a few more and seemed inclined to 
        go with us and keep up the supply.</p>
			
				<p>We gave them some 
        sugar with which they were greatly pleased they are by far the most well 
        behaved blacks we have seen on Cooper Creek.  We did not get away from 
        the Camp until <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>9 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30am. continuing our course down 
        the most southern branch of the creek which keeps a general SW course  
        we passed across the stony point which abutts [sic] on one of largest 
        waterholes in the creek and camped at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>12 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30 about 
        a mile below the most dangerous part of this risky path.  at this latter 
        place we had an accident that might have resulted badly for us, one of 
        the Camels <del rend="strikethrough">having</del> ((fell)) <del rend="strikethrough">fallen</del> whilst crossing the worst 
        part, but we fortunately got him out with only a few cuts and bruises.</p>
				<p>to Camp 
        Nº 3</p>
			
				<p>The waterhole at this 
        Camp is a very fine one being several miles long and on an average about 
        five chains broad.  The water fowl are numerous but rather shy, not nearly 
        as much so however as those on the creeks between here and Carpentaria 
        and I am convinced that the<del rend="strikethrough">ir</del> shyness of the latter which was also 
        remarked by Sturt on his trip to Eyres Creek arises entirely from the 
        scarcity of animals both human and otherwise &amp; not from any peculiar 
        mode of catching them which the blacks may have.</p>

					<date when-iso="1861-04-25">Last Night</date> was beautifully 
        calm and<lb/> 
        comparatively warm although the sky was very clear. We loaded 
        the Camels by moonlight this morning and started at a <time when-iso="05:45">quarter to six</time>.  
        Striking off to the south of the Creek we soon got on a native path which 
        leaves the creek just below the stony ground and takes a course nearly 
        <del rend="strikethrough">due</del> West across a piece of open country bounded on the south by 
        sand ridges and on the north by the scrubby ground which flanks the banks 
        of the creek at this part of the course. Leaving the path on our right 
        at a distance of three miles we turned up a small creek which passes down 
        between some sandhills and finding a nice patch of feed for the Camels 
        at a waterhole we halted at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>7 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>15 for breakfast.  
        we started again at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>9 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>50am continuing our westerly 
        course along the path we crossed to the south of the watercourse above 
        the water and proceeded over the most splendid open saltbush country that 
        one could wish to see bounded on the left by sandhills, 
        whilst to the right the peculiar looking flat topped sandstone ranges 
        from an extensive amphitheatre through the far side of the arena of which 
        may be traced the dark line of Creek timber. At twelve oclock we camped 
        in the bed of the creek at Camp Nº    [gap=sic] our last camp 
        on the road down from the Gulf having taken four days to do what we then 
        did in one.  this comparative rest and the change of diet have also worked 
        wonders however.  The leg tied [sic] feeling is now entirely gone and 
        I believe that in less than a week we shall be fit to undergo any fatigue 
        whatever.  The Camels are improving, and seem capable of doing all that 
        we are likely to require of them.</p>

				<p>First part of night 
        clear with a light breeze from South  temperature at midnight 10 deg (Reaumur)  
        towards morning there were a few Cir Cum cloud passing over from NE to 
        SW but they disappeared before day light  at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>5am the temp<hi rend="superscript">re</hi> 
        was 7.5 degs (Reaumur).</p>
			
				<p>We started at six 
        oclock and following the native path which at about a mile from <hi rend="italic">our</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">Camp</hi> takes a southerly direction we soon came to the high sandy 
        alluvial deposit which seperates [sic] the Creek at this point from the 
        stony rises.  Here we struck off from the path keeping well to the south 
        of the Creek in order that we might shift in a branch of it that took 
        a southerly direction.  At <time when-iso="09:20:00"><hi rend="superscript">h</hi>9 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>20 </time>we came up on 
        ((the Creek)) again where it runs due south and halted for breakfast at 
        fine waterhole with fine fresh feed for the Camels.  Here we remained 
        until noon when we moved on again and camped at one oclock, on 
        a general course having been throughout the morning S W 8 miles.  The 
        weather is most agreeable &amp; pleasant nothing could be more favorable 
        for us up to the present time.  The temperature [in?] the shade at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>10 
        30am was 17.5 (Reaumer) [sic] with a light breeze from south and a few 
        small cir Cum clouds towards the North.</p>
			
				<p>I greatly feel the 
        want of more instruments the only things I have left being my watch, prism 
        [?] Compass, pocket compass, and one thermometer (Reaumur)</p>

        down the bed of the Creek in a Westerly direction by moonlight.  Our stage 
        was however very short for about a mile  one of the camels ((Landa)) got 
        bogged by the side of a waterhole, and although we tried every means in 
        our power we found it impossible to get him out.  All the ground beneath 
        the surface was a bottomless quicksand through which the beast sank too 
        rapidly for us to get bushes or timber fairly beneath him, and being of 
        a very sluggish stupid nature he could never be got to make sufficiently 
        strenuous efforts towards extricating himself.  in the evening, as a last 
        chance we let the water in from the creek so as to bouy [sic] him up and 
        at the same time soften the ground about his legs but it was of no avail.  
        The Brute lay quietly in it as if he quite enjoyed his position.</p>

        a mile and then crossed over, at a Native Camp, to the left where we got 
        on a path running due West, the Creek having turned to the North  following

        and started at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>6 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30.  following down the left 
        bank of the creek in a westerly direction we came at a distance of six 
        miles on a lot of natives who were camped in the bed of the creek  they 
        seemed to have just breakfasted and were most liberal in the presentations 
        of fish and cake  we could only return the compliments by some fish hooks 
        &amp; sugar.  About a mile further on we came to a seperation [sic] of 
        the Creek, where what looked like the main branch turned towards the South  
        this channel we followed not however without some misgivings as to its 
        character which were soon increased by the small and unfavorable appearance 
        that the creek assumed.  on our continuing along it a little further it 
        began to improve and widened out with fine water holes of considerable 
        depth, the banks were very steep and a belt of scrub lined it on either 
        side  this made it very inconvenient for travelling especially as the 
        bed of the creek was full of water for considerable distances.  At <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>11.0am 
        we halted until <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>1 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30pm and then moved on again 
        then taking ((to)) a SSW course for about two miles when at the end of 
        a very long waterhole it breaks into billibongs which continue splitting 
        into sandy channels until they are all lost in the earthy soil of a box 
        forest.  Seeing little chance of water ahead we turned back to the end 
        of the long water-hole and camped for the night.  On our way back Rajah 
        showed signs of being done up, he had been trembling greatly all the morning, 
        on this account his load was further lightened to the amount of a few 
        pounds by the doing away with the Sugar, Ginger, Tea, Coca and two or 
        three tin plates.</p>
			
				<p>Last night was fine 
        &amp; clear and unusually cold the temperature at half past Nine pm was 
        10.0 and at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>4 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30  6.3 deg, a cool south- [new

				<p>Night &amp; morning 
        very cold.  Sky clear, almost calm, occasionally a light breath of air 
        from South.  Rajah appears to feel the cold very much  he was so stiff

        am at the same spot as we breakfasted at yesterday, proceeding from there 
        down the Creek we soon found a repetition of the features that were exhibited

        last water hole and below that the the [sic] channel became more sandy

				<p>Started by myself 
        to reconnoitre the country in a southerly direction, leaving M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 
        Burke &amp; King with the Camel at Camp 10.  travelled SW by S for two 
        hours following the course of the most southerly billibongs found the 
        earthy soil becoming more loose and cracked up and the box timber gradually 
        disappearing.  changed course west for a high sand ridge which I reached 
        in one hour and a half, and continuing in the same direction to one still 
        higher, obtained from it a good view of the surrounding country.  To the 
        North were the extensive box forests bounding the Creek on either side.  
        to the East Earthy plains intersected by watercourses and lines of timber 
        and bounded in the distance by sand ridges.  To the south the projection 
        of the sand ridges partially intercepted the view the rest was composed 
        of earthy plains apparently clothed with chrysanthemums,  To the west-ward 
        another but smaller plain was bounded also by high sandridges running 
        nearly parallel with the one on which I 
        was standing.</p>
			
				<p>This dreary prospect 
        offering no encouragement for one to proceed I returned to Camp 10 by 
        a more direct and better route than I had come passing over some good 
        saltbush land which borders on the billibongs to the westward.</p>
			
				<p>Nothing could be finer 
        than the weather has been for the last three weeks.  the winds have generally 
        been from the South, Blowing freshly throughout the day and then dying 
        away in the evening sometimes a stiff breeze has continued to blow during 
        the night, which has then felt unusually cold but the night [sic] have 
        generally been calm and cloudless.</p>
			
				<p>To day there is a 
        light breeze from NNE and a few wind [t---] towards the South.  The upper 
        current has generally been from Westwards</p>

				<p>Moved up the creek 
        again to Camp Nº 9 at the Junction to breakfast and remained 
        the day there.</p>
			
				<p>The present state 
        of things is not calculated to raise our spirits much the rations are 
        rapidly diminishing our clothing, especially the boots are all going to 
        pieces and we have not the materials for repairing them properly.  The 
        Camel is completely done up and can scarcely get along, although he has 
        the best of feed and is resting half his time.  I suppose this will end 
        in our having to live like the blacks for a few months</p>
			
			
				<p>Last night was clear 
        &amp; calm but not as cold as the nights have usually been.</p>
			
				<p>the wind which blew 
        lightly during the morning from the northward died away about noon and 
        a few Cir Cum clouds made their appearance gradually collecting until 
        they formed into heavy Cum Strat moving slowly from N to South  In the 
        evening the sky cleared, but clouded over again towards morning with small 
        cir Cum moving slowly from NW to SE</p>

				<p>Breakfasted at daylight 
        but when about to start found that the Camel would not rise even without 
        any load on his back.  after making every attempt to get him up we were 
        obliged to leave him to himself.</p>
			
				<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Burke 
        and I started down the Creek to reconnoitre, At about eleven miles we 
        came to some Blacks fishing, they gave us some half a dozen fish each 
        for luncheon and intimated that if we would go to their Camp we should 
        have some more and some bread.  I tore in two a piece of Mackintosh stuff 
        that I had and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.B. gave one piece and I the other, we then 
        went on to their Camp about three Miles further.  they had caught a considerable 
        quantity of fish but most of them were small.  I noticed three different 
        kinds.  A small one that they call Cupi, five to six inches long and not 
        broader than an eel.  the common ones with large coarse scales 
        termed Peru and a delicious fish some of which run from a pound to two 
        pounds weight the Natives call them Cawitchi.</p>
			
				<p>On our arrival at 
        the Camp they led us to a spot to camp on, and soon afterwards brought 
        a lot of fish &amp; bread which they call Nardu.  the lighting a fire 
        with matches greatly delights them but they do not care about having them.  
        in the evening various members of the tribe came down with lumps of Nardu 
        and handfuls of fish until we were positively unable to eat any more.  
        They also gave us some stuff they call Bedgery or Pedgery.  it has a highly 
        intoxicating effect when chewed even in small quantities it appears to 
        be the dried stems and leaves of some shrub.</p>

        Junction whilst I proceeded to trace down the Creek.  this I found a shorter 
        task than I had expected for it soon showed signs of running out and at 
        the same time kept considerably to the north of West.  there were several 
        fine waterholes within about four miles of the Camp I had left but not 
        a drop all the way beyond that, a distance of seven miles.  Finding that 
        the creek turned greatly towards the North I returned to the Blacks encampment 
        and as I was about to pass they invited me to stay so I did so, and was 
        even more hospitably entertained than before being on this occasion offered 
        a share of a gunnya and supplied with plenty of fish and Nardu, as well 
        as a couple of nice fat rats, the latter found most delicious, They 
        were baked in the skins.</p>

        the fire up during the night.</p>

        found that the flat was covered with them, this discovery caused somewhat 
        of a revolution in our feelings for we considered that with the knowledge 
        of this plant we were in a position to support ourselves even if we were 
        destined to remain on the creek; &amp; wait for assistance from Town  
        Crossing some sand ridges which run N &amp; S, we struck into a creek 
        which runs out of Cooper Cr, and followed it down, at about five miles 
        we came to a large water hole beyond which the watercourse runs out on 
        extensive flats and earthy plainins[sic].</p>

				<p>Started up the Creek 
        this Morning, for the Depôt in order to deposit journals and a record 
        of the state of affairs here.  on reaching the sand hills below where 
        Landa was bogged I passed some blacks on a flat collecting Nardu seed.  
        Never saw such an abundance of the seed before  the ground in some parts 
        was quite black with it.  there were only two or three gins and children 
        and they directed me on as if to their camp in the direction I was before 
        going.  but I had not gone far over the first sandhill when I was overtaken 
        by about twenty blacks bent on taking me back to their camp, and promising 
        any quantity of Nardu and fish  on my going with them one carried the 
        shovel and another insisted on taking my swag in such a friendly manner 
        that I could not refuse them</p>

				<p>They were greatly

				<p>Left the Blacks Camp 
        and proceeding up the Creek, obtained some mussels near where Landa died 
        and halted for breakfast.  still feel very unwell from the effects of 
        the constipation of the bowels the stools are exceedingly painful.  After 
        breakfast travelled on to our third Camp coming down Very Blown[?]</p>

				</p>
				<p>Started at 7 oclock 
        and went on to the duck holes where we breakfasted coming down, halted 
        there at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>9 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>30 for a feed and then moved on.  At 
        the stones saw a lot of crows quarelling [sic] about something near the 
        water, found it to be a large fish of which they had eaten a considerable 
        portion.  finding it quite fresh &amp; good I decided the quarrel by taking 
        it with me.  it proved a most valuable addition to my otherwise scanty 
        supper of Nardu porridge.  this evening I camped very comfortably in a 
        mia mia about eleven miles from the Depôt.  </p>
				<p>The night  was very 
        cold although not entirely cloudless.</p>
			
				<p>A brisk Easterly breeze 
        sprung up in the morning and blew freshly all day.  in the evening the 
        sky clouded in and there were one or two slight showers but nothing to 
        wet the ground</p>
			
			
				<p>Thursday 
        May 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Reached the Depot 
        this morning at 11 oclock, no traces of any one except blacks having been 
        here since we left.</p>
			
				<p>Deposited some journals 
        and a notice of our present condition.  Started back in the afternoon 
        &amp; camped at the first water hole.</p>
			
			
				<p>Last Night being cloudy 
        was unusually warm and pleasant</p>

        delayed about half an hour on the road in gathering some portulac.   it 
        had been a fine morning but the sky now became overcast and threatened 
        to set in for steady rain and as I felt very weak and tired I only moved 
        on about a mile further and camped in a sheltered gully under some rushes.</p>
			
			
			
				<p>Night clear and very 
        cold, no wind.  towards Morning sky became slightly overcast with cirro

        camp up at <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>2 pm having rested in the meantime about <hi rend="superscript">m</hi>45 
        minutes.  thought to have reached the Blacks Camp or at least where Landa 
        was bogged but found myself altogether too weak and exhausted in fact 
        had extreme difficulty in getting across the numerous little gullies and 
        was at last obliged to camp from sheer fatigue</p>
			
			
				<p>Night alternately 
        clear &amp; cloudy with occasional showers.</p>
			
			
				<p>Sunday June 
        2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Started at half past 
        six thinking to breakfast at the Blacks Camp below Landa grave  found 
        myself very much fagged and did not arrive at their Camp until <hi rend="superscript">h</hi>10 
        am &amp; then found myself disappointed as to a good breakfast the Camp 
        being deserted.</p>
			
				<p>Having rested a while 
        and eaten a few fish bones I moved down the creek hoping by a late march 
        to be able to reach our own camp, but I soon found from my extreme weakness 
        that that would be out of the question.</p>
			
				<p>A certain amount of 
        good luck however still stuck to me for on going along by a large water 
        hole I was so fortunate as to find a large fish about a pound &amp; half 
        in weight which was just being choked by another which it had tried to 
        swallow but which had stuck in its throat.  I soon had a fire lit and 
        both of the fish cooked and eaten.  the large one was 
        in good condition.</p>
			
				<p>Moving on again after 
        my late breakfast I passed camp No LXVII of the Journey to Carpentaria 
        and camped for the night under some polygonum bushes.</p>
			
				<p>Monday June 
        3<hi rend="superscript">rd </hi>1861</p>
			
				<p>Started at seven oclock 
        and keeping on the south bank of the creek was rather encouraged at about 
        three miles by [the] sound of numerous crows a head presently fancied 
        could see smoke and was shortly afterwards set at my ease by hearing a 
        cooey from Pitchery who stood on the opposite bank and directed me around 
        the lower end of the waterhole continually repeating his assurance of 
        abundance of fish &amp; bread.</p>
			
				<p>having with some considerable 
        difficulty managed to ascend the sandy path that led to the Camp I was 
        conducted by the Chief to a fire where a large pile of fish were just 
        been cooked in the most approved style.  these I imagined to be for the 
        general consumption of the half a dozen natives gathered around but it 
        turned out that they had already had their breakfast  I was expected to 
        dispose of this lot a task which to my own astonishment I soon accomplished 
        keeping two or three blacks pretty steadily at 
        work extracting the bones for me.  The fish being disposed of next came 
        a supply of Nardu Cake A[sic] water until I was so full as to be unable 
        to eat any more when Pitchery allowing me a short time to recover myself 
        fetched a large bowl of the raw Nardu flour mixed to a thin paste a most 
        insinuating article and one that they appear to esteem a great delicacy.  
        I was then invited stop the night there, but this I declined and proceeded 
        on my way home.</p>
			
				<p>Tuesday June 
        4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Started for the Blacks 
        camp intending to test the practicability of living with them and to see 
        what I could learn as to their ways &amp; manners</p>
			
			
				<p>Wednesday 
        June 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Remained with the 
        Blacks</p>
			
			
				<p>Light rain during 
        the greater part of the night and more or less throughout the day in showers  
        Wind blowing in squalls from South</p>
			
			
				<p>Thursday 
        June 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Returned to our own 
        Camp.  found that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burke &amp; King had been well supplied 
        with fish by the Blacks.  <del rend="strikethrough">Ma</del> made preparation for shifting our 
        camp near to theirs on the morrow</p>
			
			
				<p>Friday June 
        7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>Started in the afternoon 
        for the Blacks Camp with such things as we could take, found ourselves 
        all very weak inspite [sic] of the abundant supply of fish that we have 
        lately had.  I myself could scarcely get along although carrying the lightest 
        swag only about thirty pounds.</p>
			
				<p>found that the Blacks 
        had decamped so determined on proceeding to morrow up to  the next camp 
        near the Nardu field</p>
			
			
				<p>Saturday 
        June 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>With the greatest 
        fatigue &amp; difficulty we reached the Nardu Camp.  No Blacks greatly 
        to our disappointment.  took possession of their best Mia Mia and rested 
        for the remainder of the day.</p>

				<p>The Night was alternately 
        cloudy &amp; clear the clouds moving from NE to SW.  Shortly before day 
        break a few light drops of rain fell the sky then cleared and a beautiful 
        sunrise was succeeded by a fine cool morning the sky being partially covered 
        with Cirro Str &amp; Cir Cum clouds.  A light breeze sprang up in East 
        at 7am &amp; shifted to N &amp; N by W with a force of (5) soon after 
        noon it moved to West blowing lightly.</p>

        some change in the system.  I have never yet recovered from the effects

        a crow this morning.</p>
			
				<p>the rain kept all 
        hands in pounding &amp; cleaning seed during the morning.  The weather 
        cleared up towards the middle <del rend="strikethrough">part</del> of the day and a brisk breeze 
        sprang up in the South lasting till near sunset but rather irregular in 
        its force.  distant thunder was audible to Westward &amp; Southward frequently 
        during the afternoon.</p>

				<p>Exceedingly cold night.  
        Sky clear, slight breeze very chilly and changeable, very heavy dew.

				<p>Night Calm, sky during 
        first part overcast with Cir Cum clouds, most of which cleared ((Away)) 
        towards morning leaving the air much colder but the sky remained more 
        or less hazy all night and it was not nearly as cold as last night.</p>
			
				<p>About 8 oclock a strong 
        southerly wind sprung up which enabled King to blow the dust out out [sic] 
        of our nardue seed but made me too too [sic] weak to render him any assistance.</p>

					<note>[Here follow some

				<p>The Southerly breeze 
        sprung up again at 7am as before and in the afternoon shifted a little 
        to Eastward bringing up Nimbous [sic] looking clouds, a few drops of rain 
        fell.  towards night the wind rather increased in fore continuing to blow 
        until near morning</p>

				<p>Night and morning 
        very cold sky clear.  I am completely reduced by the effects of the cold 
        and starvation.</p>
			
				<p>King gone out for 
        Nardu M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burke at home pounding seed, he finds himself getting 
        very weak in the legs, King holds out by far the best the foods seems 
        to agree with him pretty well.</p>
			
				<p>Finding the Sun come 
        out pretty warm towards Noon, I took a sponging all over but it seemed 
        to do little good beyond the cleaning effects for my weakness is great 
        that I could not do it with proper expedition.</p>
			
				<p>I cannot understand 
        this Nardu at all it certainly will not agree with me in any form we are 
        now reduced to it alone and we manage to get from four to five pounds 
        per day between us.  the stools it causes are enormous and seem greatly 
        to exceed the quantity of bread consumed and is very slightly altered 
        in appearance from what it was when eaten.</p>

				<p>Southerly breeze similar 
        to yesterday during the morning shifted in afternoon to SE bringing up 
        vapour Cir Cum.  Thunder was repeatedly audible to windward and at 4 30pm 
        a smart shower and heavy squall passed over us.  There were several slight 
        showers during the night and the transit of a cloud was invariably marked 
        by a squall from SE.</p>

				<p>Last Night was ((<del rend="strikethrough">a</del>)) 
        cold ((&amp;)) clear winding up with a strong wind from NE in the morning.  
        I feel much weaker than ever and can scarcely crawl out of the Mia Mia.  
        Unless relief comes in some form or other I cannot possibly last more 
        than a fortnight.</p>
			
				<p>It is a great consolation 
        at least in this position of ours to know that we we [sic] have done all 
        we could and that our deaths will rather be the result of the mismanagement 
        of others than of any rash acts of our own.  had we been come to grief 
        elsewhere we could only have blamed ourselves but here we are returned 
        to Cooper Creek where we had every reason to look for provisions &amp; 
        clothing, and yet we have to die of starvation in spite of the explicit 
        instructions given by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Burke That the Depôt party should 
        await our return, and the strong recommendation to the Committee that 
        we should be followed up by a party from Mininda.</p>
			
				<p>About Noon a change 
        of wind took place and it blew almost as hard from the west as it was 
        previously from the NE  a few cir Cum continued to pass over towards East.</p>
				<p>
					<note>[Here follow some 
        meteorological notes which appear to relate to another period]</note>

				<p>Smart dry breeze from 
        South commencing about 7am continued throughout the day until sunset this 
        was succeeded by a calm clear night during which the temperature fell 
        very low compared with what we have been accustomed</p>

				<p>Monday June 
        24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1861</p>
			
				<p>A Fearful night.  
        At about an hour before sunset a Southerly gale sprung up and continued 
        throughout the greater portion of the night the cold was intense and it 
        seemed as if one would be completely shrivelled up towards morning it 
        fortunately lulled a little but a strong cold breeze continued till near 
        sunset after which it became perfectly calm.</p>
			
				<p>King went out for 
        Nardu in spite of the wind and came in with a good load but he himself 
        terribly cut up  he says that he can no longer keep up the work &amp; 
        as he &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Burke are both getting rapidly weaker we have 
        but a slight chance of anything but starvation unless we can get hold 
        of some blacks.</p>

        23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> [sic] 1861</p>
			
				<p>Night calm clear &amp; 
        intensely cold especially towards morning.  near daybreak King reported 
        seeing a moon in the east with a haze of light stretching up from it.  
        he declared it to be quite as large as the moon and not dim at the edges  
        I am so weak that any attempt to get a sight of it was out of the question; 
        but I think it must have been Venus in the Zodiacal light that he saw, 
        with a corona around her</p>
			
				<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Burke 
        &amp; King remain at home cleaning &amp; pounding seed; they both getting 
        weaker every day, the Cold plays the deuce with us from the small amount 
        of clothing we have my wardrobe consists of a wide awake, a merino shirt, 
        a regatta shirt without sleeves, the remains of a pair of flannel trousers, 
        two pairs of socks in rags, and a waistcoat of which I have managed to 
        keep the pockets together.  the others are no better off.  besides these 
        we have between us for bedding two small camel-pads, some horse hair two 
        or three little bits of a rug, &amp; pieces of oil cloth saved from the 
        fire.</p>
			
				<p>The day turned out 
        nice and warm.</p>

				<p>Calm night, sky overcast 
        with hazy Cum strat clouds.  An easterly breeze sprung up towards morning 
        making the air much colder, after sunrise there were indications of a 
        clearing up of the sky but it soon clouded in again, the upper current 
        continuing to move in an easterly direction, whilst a breeze from the 
        E and NE blew pretty regularly throughout the day.  M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burke 
        &amp; King are preparing to go up the creek in search of the blacks, they 
        will leave me some nardu, wood &amp; water with which I must do the best 
        I can until they return.  <hi rend="italic">I think this is almost our only chance</hi>
					<hi rend="italic"/> I feel myself if anything rather better, but I cannot say stronger, 
        the nardu is beginning to agree better with me.  but without some change 
        I see little chance for any of us.  They have both shown great hesitation 
        and reluctance with regard to leaving me and have repeatedly desired my 
        candid opinion in the matter.  I could only repeat however that I considered 
        it our only chance for I could not last long on the nardue, even if a 
        supply could be kept up.</p>

				<p>Clear cold night, 
        slight breeze from the East day beautifully warm and pleasant.  M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					<persName key="Burke">Burke</persName> suffers greatly from the cold &amp; is getting extremely weak <persName key="Burke">he</persName> 
        &amp; <persName>King</persName> start to-((<del rend="strikethrough">o</del>))morrow up the creek to look for the blacks.  
        It is the only chance we have of being saved from starvation  I am weaker 
        than ever<del rend="strikethrough">y</del> although I have a good appetite and relish the nardu 
        much but it seems to give us no nutriment &amp; the birds here are so 
        shy as not to be got at.  Even [Even is written over something else] 
        if we got a good supply of fish I doubt whether we could do much work 
        on them and the nardue alone, nothing now but the greatest good luck can 
        now save any of us and as for myself, I may live four or five days if 
        the weather continues warm.  my pulse are at forty-eight &amp; very weak 
        and my legs &amp; arms are nearly skin and bone: I can only look out like 
        <persName ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkins_Micawber">Mr. Micawber</persName> for <hi rend="italic">something to turn</hi> up but starvation on nardu 
        is by no means very unpleasant but for the weakness one feels and the 
        utter inability to move oneself, for as far as appetite is concerned, 
        it gives me the greatest satisfaction certainly fat &amp; sugar would 
        be more to ones taste, in fact those seem to me to be the great standby 
        for one in this extraordinary continent, not that I mean to depreciate 
        the farinaceous food, but the want of sugar &amp; fat in all substances 
        obtainable here is so great that they become almost valueless to us as 
        articles of food, without the addition of something else.</p>
