			<p>PRINT VERSION OF

				See also the
				<ref target="http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/wills/pages/intro10.html">Introduction</ref>
				for explanation of some conventions used in this 2002 version of the transcript,
				including:
			</p>
			<p>
				<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>
				7
				<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>
				30.
				When Wills writes times, he puts 'h' above the hour and 'm' above the
				minutes. This could not be replicated this
				exactly in type.
			</p>
			<p>New sentences, as
				far as they can be determined, are indicated by a leading double space.
				Wills often did not use
				punctuation or beginning capitals.
			</p>
			<p>Wills's crossed-out
				words and sentences have been reinstated, and this transcript tries to
				indicate where words were
				written over others

					April 1861 in an exhausted

					had
					started for the Darling with their horses and Camels fresh and in good
					condition, deemed it useless to attempt to
					overtake them, having only
					two Camels, both done up, and being so weak themselves as to be unable
					to walk more than
					four or five miles a day. Finding also that the provisions
					left at the Depôt for them would scarcely take them to
					Meninda, started
					down Cooper Creek for Adelaide, via

					1861, intending to follow as nearly as possible the route
					taken by Gregory.  by so doing they hoped to be able to
					recruit themselves
					&amp; the Camels whilst sauntering slowly down the Creek and
					to have sufficient provisions left to
					take them comfortably or at least
					without risk to some station in South Australia.

				<p>As

					to get about twelve pounds
					of fish for a few pieces of straps and some
					matches &amp;c this is a great treat for us as well as a valuable
					addition
					to our rations.  We started at

					15pm on our way
					down the Creek the Blacks going in the opposite direction, little thinking
					that in a few miles they
					would be able to get lots pieces for nothing
					better than those they had obtained from us.
